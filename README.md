- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Began with the mobile design and scaled it up to desktop after. Put this together much quicker than the previous challenge, with far fewer difficulties. Kept the hover states simple - might update with something more interesting at a later date.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS variables and nested properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This one came together rather seamlessly, which I was happy about. I take it to mean I've made some improvements in terms how I think about the components. There is something of a thin black-line between the 1st and 2nd card however. It's also on the prototype though - any ideas on how to get rid of it?
